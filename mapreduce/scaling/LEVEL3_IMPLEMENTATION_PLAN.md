# Level 3 Master-Worker Architecture Implementation Plan

## 📊 **Current Implementation Analysis**

### **Existing Level 2 Capabilities**

### **Level 2 → Level 3 Evolution Needed**
🔄 **Components to Transform:**

- **ThreadPoolExecutor** → **Worker Node Pool** (distributed execution)
- **Local File System** → **Distributed File System** (HDFS-like)
- **Function Calls** → **Network RPC** (remote procedure calls)
- **Memory Sharing** → **Network Communication** (serialization/deserialization)

## 🏗️ **Level 3 Master-Worker Architecture Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Distributed Components**

#### **1.1 Master Node (`MasterNode`)**
```python
class MasterNode:
    """Centralized coordinator for distributed MapReduce execution"""
    - job_queue: Queue[JobConfig]
    - worker_registry: Dict[str, WorkerInfo]
    - task_assignment: Dict[str, str]  # task_id -> worker_id
    - heartbeat_monitor: HeartbeatMonitor
    - data_locality_optimizer: DataLocalityOptimizer
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Job submission and scheduling
- Worker registration and health monitoring
- Task assignment with data locality optimization
- Global job state management
- Failure detection and task reassignment

#### **1.2 Worker Node (`WorkerNode`)**
```python
class WorkerNode:
    """Distributed task executor with local resource management"""
    - worker_id: str
    - local_data_store: LocalDataStore
    - task_executor: TaskExecutor
    - rpc_server: RPCServer
    - resource_monitor: ResourceMonitor
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Task execution (map/reduce operations)
- Local data management
- Resource monitoring and reporting
- Heartbeat communication with master
- Local intermediate file management

### **Phase 2: Network Communication Layer**

#### **2.1 RPC Communication (`RPCSystem`)**
```python
class RPCSystem:
    """Remote Procedure Call system for master-worker communication"""
    - message_serializer: MessageSerializer
    - network_transport: NetworkTransport
    - request_router: RequestRouter
    - response_handler: ResponseHandler
```

**Protocols:**
- **Master → Worker**: Task assignment, heartbeat requests, data transfer
- **Worker → Master**: Task completion, progress updates, resource status
- **Worker → Worker**: Intermediate data shuffling

#### **2.2 Message Types**
```python
@dataclass
class TaskAssignmentMessage:
    task_id: str
    task_type: str
    input_data_locations: List[DataLocation]
    map_function: bytes  # Serialized function
    reduce_function: bytes  # Serialized function

@dataclass
class TaskCompletionMessage:
    task_id: str
    success: bool
    output_location: DataLocation
    execution_stats: ExecutionStats
```

### **Phase 3: Data Locality and Distribution**

#### **3.1 Distributed Data Store (`DistributedDataStore`)**
```python
class DistributedDataStore:
    """HDFS-like distributed file system for MapReduce"""
    - data_nodes: Dict[str, DataNode]
    - replication_factor: int = 3
    - block_size: int = 64 * 1024 * 1024  # 64MB blocks
    - metadata_store: MetadataStore
```

**Features:**
- File splitting into distributed blocks
- Multi-node replication for fault tolerance
- Data locality tracking for optimization
- Automatic load balancing

#### **3.2 Data Locality Optimizer (`DataLocalityOptimizer`)**
```python
class DataLocalityOptimizer:
    """Optimizes task placement based on data location"""
    - data_location_tracker: DataLocationTracker
    - network_topology: NetworkTopology
    - load_balancer: LoadBalancer
```

**Strategies:**
- **Local**: Execute on node containing the data
- **Rack-Local**: Execute on same rack as data
- **Remote**: Execute remotely with data transfer
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available nodes
